# triangular_base_xbox
This repo contains arduino code for 3WD robotic base. I have used 1 main controller(master) and 3 slave controllers. The master provides desired rpm value to slave via I2C communication and the slave drives the robot seamlessly. I have used PID control for better stabilization. Work with IMU is on the way!!!
